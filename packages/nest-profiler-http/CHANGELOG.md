# @eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http

## 1.0.0-alpha.11

### Patch Changes

- Version bump only — released in lockstep with `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler` to keep the suite on a single version (Changesets `fixed` group). No functional changes to this package.

## 1.0.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- 1735b38: Document the `@alpha` install tag in every package README.

  - Install commands now pin `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler*` packages to the `@alpha` dist-tag, since there is no stable release yet (`@latest` resolves to nothing).
  - Added a short note next to each install snippet explaining the requirement.

## 1.0.0-alpha.9

### Major Changes

- 6ce7e47: Define what counts as an **error**, per package (breaking).

  "Error" had one hardcoded meaning: any status ≥ 400, plus any captured exception, always `danger`. But a `404` is a bug for one team and an ordinary answer for another, and a status code means nothing to GraphQL, RabbitMQ or a CLI command. Each entrypoint kind now carries its own definition, and you can redefine it — the `error` tag, its pills and the list's **Errors** checkbox all follow. See [What counts as an error](https://nestjs-profiler-module.vercel.app/en/docs/packages/nest-profiler/error-classification).

  **BREAKING — 4xx are no longer errors.** The default is now a status ≥ 500, or a captured exception when no status was recorded. Profiles previously tagged `error` for a `401`/`403`/`404` no longer are, and the **Errors** checkbox no longer keeps them. Restore the old behaviour with `ProfilerModule.forRoot({ error: { httpStatus: 400 } })`. The same shift applies to **outgoing HTTP calls** (`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http`): a call is failed when it threw or answered ≥ 500 — restore with `HttpCollectorModule.forRoot({ error: { httpStatus: 400 } })`.

  The layers resolve in order, first decisive: `classify` (tri-state — return `undefined` to defer) → `httpStatus`, which when a status is present decides **on its own** → `exceptions`, the fallback for kinds without a status. Layer 2 being decisive is what keeps the defaults coherent: a `NotFoundException` produces both an exception and a `404`, so consulting the exceptions too would contradict the status and re-flag the very 404 you excluded.

  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`** — new `error` option on `ProfilerModule.forRoot()` governing the built-in `http` kind. `ProfilerEntrypointType` gains `isError`/`errorSeverity` (a kind's verdict) and `hiddenFilters` (universal filters it drops from its list). `TagConfig` gains `isErrorEntry`/`errorSeverity`, so `error` is finally severity-configurable like the five other built-in tags. New exports: `resolveProfileErrorClassifier`, `resolveEntryErrorClassifier`, `resolveErrorSeverity`, `buildHttpEntrypointType`, and the `ProfilerErrorOptions`/`EntryErrorOptions`/`ProfileErrorInfo` types. `analyzeProfile()` takes an optional 4th argument carrying the kind's verdict (existing calls keep working; without it, only entries can be errors).
  - **New `Exception` list filter** — narrows to one failure type, with options built from the values actually captured (no configuration). It complements the **Errors** checkbox rather than duplicating it: `Errors` asks "what failed, per my definition", `Exception` asks "show me the `NotFoundException`s", whether or not they count as failures. Backed by a new universal `exception` index attribute (the primary exception's code, else its class name).
  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-graphql`** — new `error` option. A GraphQL response is `200` even when the operation failed, so statuses are ignored and `extensions.code` takes their role: only `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` counts by default, plus errors carrying no code. `BAD_USER_INPUT`/`UNAUTHENTICATED`/`NOT_FOUND` are the schema answering correctly. **BREAKING:** `GraphQLCollectorModuleOptions` moved to a dedicated entrypoint (still exported from the package root) and the module now follows the `ConfigurableModuleBuilder` pattern of every other collector, gaining `forRootAsync()`. `ExceptionEntry` gains `code`, populated from `extensions.code` instead of being buried in the `stack` string.
  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-rabbitmq`** — new `error` option. A message has no status, so the default is "the handler threw"; narrow it with `error: { exceptions: ['TimeoutError'] }` when a handler throws as flow control.
  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-commander`** — a non-zero exit is a failure, and that needs no configuration. The Commands list now hides the **Errors** checkbox, its `Status: Success/Failed` filter already asking exactly that.
  - The **Errors** checkbox was labelled `With errors`; it is now `Errors`, aligned with the other filter labels (`Status`, `Method`, `Exception`). The query parameter (`<section>_error`) is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- b7471e6: Make the severity of every threshold-based performance tag configurable per collector, and drive all severity colouring in the UI from the tag's actual severity.

  Each query/HTTP collector now accepts flat severity options alongside its thresholds: `slowSeverity`, `nPlusOneSeverity`, `chattySeverity`, `zeroRowsSeverity` (query collectors) and `slowSeverity`, `nPlusOneSeverity`, `chattySeverity`, `largePayloadSeverity` (HTTP). Each defaults to today's value (`slow`/`chatty`/`large-payload`/`zero-rows` → `warning`, `n-plus-one` → `danger`); `error` stays `danger` and is not configurable. `TagConfig` gains the matching optional fields.

  The dashboard now colours the query/HTTP panels consistently: the duration text, the "slow" sublabel, the summary "N slow" / "N N+1" counts, the row highlight and the badge pill all follow the tag's severity. Previously `slow` (a `warning`) was rendered red in the duration column and summary while its pill was amber; a missing `warning` background token also left the slow-row highlight invisible. New `warning` / `info` semantic colour tokens back this.

  Note: because colouring now follows severity, raising a tag's severity (e.g. `slowSeverity: 'danger'`) intentionally turns its duration text, counts, row highlight, pill and the performance banner red.

## 1.0.0-alpha.8

### Major Changes

- 000cb7d: Make the HTTP collector genuinely client-agnostic: pluggable axios/fetch instrumentations with subpath exports and auto-discovery, plus a documented path to bring your own client.

  BREAKING: adapters are now selected explicitly by importing their class from a subpath; the `axios` flag and the `axiosRef` option are removed.

  - Ship two opt-in, subpath-isolated instrumentations, each selected via `instrumentations: [...]`: `AxiosInstrumentation` (`/axios`) and `FetchInstrumentation` (`/fetch`). Both capture request and response bodies safely. Nothing is instrumented unless listed; the root barrel exports only the client-agnostic API and never loads a client library.
  - `AxiosInstrumentation` now **auto-discovers** every axios instance in the DI container via `DiscoveryService` — every `@nestjs/axios` `HttpService` (including per-feature `HttpModule.register()` instances) and bare axios instances — so multiple clients are captured with no per-instance wiring. It still never imports `@nestjs/axios`.
  - `FetchInstrumentation` patches `globalThis.fetch` (Node ≥ 22 built-in, undici-backed) and needs no dependency.
  - Any other client (got, undici, superagent, a bespoke NestJS service…) is covered by implementing the `HttpInstrumentation` interface with the client's own hooks, or by recording inline via `HttpProfilerRecorder.capture(...)` — both documented, and both yield full request/response fidelity.
  - BREAKING: the `axios` boolean flag is removed — select axios via `instrumentations: [AxiosInstrumentation]`. The `axiosRef` option is removed — the axios adapter auto-discovers instances instead. `AxiosInstrumentation` moves from the root barrel to the `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http/axios` subpath.

  Migrate by dropping the `forRootAsync({ axiosRef })` wiring and selecting adapters instead: `HttpCollectorModule.forRoot({ instrumentations: [AxiosInstrumentation] })`, importing `AxiosInstrumentation` from `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http/axios`.

### Minor Changes

- 9b1d8a1: Public API and packaging cleanup before the stable release (breaking).

  - **GraphQL module renamed** for ecosystem consistency: `ProfilerGraphQLModule` → `GraphQLCollectorModule` and `ProfilerGraphQLModuleOptions` → `GraphQLCollectorModuleOptions` (all 11 other collectors already use `XxxCollectorModule`). No alias — update imports.
  - **`PROFILER_CONTEXT_ADAPTERS` removed** from the public API. It was never consumed by the core; the single supported way to register a context adapter is `ProfilerCoreService.registerContextAdapter(adapter)` from your module's `onModuleInit` (resolve the core with `moduleRef.get(ProfilerCoreService, { strict: false })`). The dead multi-token providers in the GraphQL and RabbitMQ modules are gone.
  - **Named ORM connections supported.** `TypeOrm`/`Mongoose`/`MikroOrm` collector options gain a `connectionName?: string`; the (optionally named) connection is injected by its resolved token, optionally, so a named-only setup no longer crashes at bootstrap and a missing connection warns instead. A `getRequest()` on context adapters lets the interceptor repose the transport request in CLS (fixes GraphQL requests showing as anonymous in the Security panel).
  - **Peer dependencies tightened.** The core peer on every collector is bounded (`>=1.0.0-alpha.7 <2.0.0`) instead of an unbounded `>=`. Optional peers (`axios`, `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq`, `amqplib`, `@nestjs/graphql`, `class-validator`, `class-transformer`) are now declared in `peerDependencies` with ranges (plus `optional: true` in meta). `nest-profiler-http` no longer peer-depends on `@nestjs/axios` (it never imports it — you provide `axiosRef` via `forRootAsync`); `nest-profiler-commander` now declares `nest-commander` as a **required** peer (imported statically) rather than optional. ORM peer ranges widened to cover the installed base: `typeorm ">=0.3.20 <2.0.0"`, `mongoose "^8 || ^9"`. `nest-profiler-mikro-orm` requires Node `>=22.12.0` (stable `require(esm)`).
  - **Misc.** A throwing custom validator extractor can no longer turn a 400 into a 500; the RabbitMQ adapter's options are `@Optional()`; the dead `COMMANDER_COLLECTOR_OPTIONS` token is removed; the RabbitMQ package builds via the shared `repo-build`. `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq` is now a dev dependency.

- 882e5ac: Add `forRootAsync` to every collector whose options are resolved at runtime, so masking, thresholds and capture flags can be driven from `ConfigService` (or any provider) instead of static literals.

  - New `forRootAsync({ imports?, inject?, useFactory })` on `TypeOrmCollectorModule`, `MongooseCollectorModule`, `MikroOrmCollectorModule`, `ConfigCollectorModule`, `AuthCollectorModule`, `RabbitMqCollectorModule` and `ValidatorCollectorModule`, mirroring the existing `HttpCollectorModule.forRootAsync`. Each package also exports a matching `*CollectorModuleAsyncOptions` type.
  - Collectors now share a `ConfigurableModuleBuilder`-based options token and a single `buildCollectorModule` helper (exported from `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`) that centralizes the synchronous `enabled: false` short-circuit — so disabling behaves consistently across every collector.
  - `enabled` stays a synchronous build-time flag (it decides which providers are registered, which an async factory cannot); per-environment gating remains the host's job via `ConditionalModule.registerWhen(...)`. `HttpCollectorModule` is refactored onto the shared builder with no change to its public API (`HTTP_COLLECTOR_OPTIONS`, `HTTP_INSTRUMENTATIONS`, `axios`/`instrumentations` and the `axiosRef` contract are preserved).
  - `cache`, `commander` and `graphql` are intentionally left `forRoot`-only: their sole option is `enabled`, which has nothing to resolve asynchronously.

- ffa4d9a: Detect performance anti-patterns (N+1, slow, error, chatty, large-payload) across SQL, Mongo and outgoing HTTP with a rule-based tagging engine.

  The core now runs a single analysis pass (`analyzeProfile`) once per profile — after every collector, before persistence — that groups entries on a collector-supplied `fingerprint` and applies `PerformanceRule`s, attaching structured `ProfilerTag[]` (`{ id, label, severity, count?, detail? }`) to each entry and aggregating them onto `profile.tags`. Built-in rules: `slow`, `n-plus-one` (the N+1 anti-pattern), `error`, `chatty` and `large-payload` (HTTP). Contribute your own via `ProfilerModule.forRoot({ performance: { rules: [...] } })` or `ProfilerCoreService.registerPerformanceRule()`; the emitted tag ids become filterable.

  Tags surface as coloured pills on each query/HTTP row and in the panel headers; the detail page shows a prominent **Performance** banner listing the issues and colour-codes the affected collector's nav tab by severity (the tab badge stays a plain count). On the list page, tags render as pills and a new **Performance tag** filter (Slow / N+1 / Chatty / Large payload, plus any custom id via `registerFilterOption('tag', …)`) plus a separate **With errors** checkbox replace the former **With exceptions** checkbox (errors are failures, not performance issues; the checkbox is broader — it covers failed HTTP/query calls too). The SQLite adapter gains an indexed `tags` column.

  **Breaking changes**

  - The per-query `isSlow` boolean is removed from `QueryEntry`, `MongooseQueryEntry` and the Mongo entry shape; "slow" is now the `slow` tag, computed centrally by the engine (no longer at capture time). Read it from `entry.tags` (or `profile.tags`).
  - Each collector's `slowQueryThreshold` option is renamed to `slowThreshold`, and gains sibling options `nPlusOneThreshold` (default 2) and `chattyThreshold` (default 20; `10` for HTTP). The HTTP collector additionally gains `slowThreshold` (default 300 ms) and `largePayloadThreshold` (default 1 MB).
  - The built-in `hasExceptions` list filter is removed in favour of the generic `tag` filter.

- 9b1d8a1: Reliability fixes across the profiler.

  - **Correct HTTP error status.** A non-`HttpException` thrown from a handler is now recorded as `500` instead of a stale `200`, matching the non-HTTP path.
  - **Disabling the profiler no longer removes validation.** `ValidatorCollectorModule.forRoot({ enabled: false })` still installs the bare validation pipe (your `pipe` or the default class-validator one), just without profiling.
  - **GraphQL filters fixed.** `ignoreGraphQLIntrospection` no longer misclassifies the ubiquitous `__typename` meta-field as introspection (it matched `__type`), so real traffic is profiled again. `ignoreGraphQLPlayground` is now scoped to the GraphQL endpoint path (default `/graphql`, configurable via the new `createIgnoreGraphQLPlayground(path)`), so it no longer suppresses every HTML page of a mixed SSR + GraphQL app.
  - **Mongoose writes are captured.** `document.save()` / `Model.create()`, `insertMany()` and `bulkWrite()` now appear in the MongoDB panel (previously only `Query`/`Aggregate` reads were visible).
  - **Disabled core no longer crashes collectors.** Collectors resolve the core's global providers (`ClsService`, `ProfilerCoreService`, the ORM connection) lazily via `ModuleRef.get(token, { strict: false })` in `onModuleInit` and degrade to a no-op when they are absent, so `ProfilerModule.forRoot({ enabled: false })` / `ProfilerNoopModule` with a collector left enabled boots cleanly instead of failing DI. (A plain `@Optional()` dependency does not traverse to a global module from a dynamic feature module, so it could not be used here.) The HTTP `HttpProfilerRecorder` stays injectable (no-op) when disabled.
  - **Dashboard performance.** The list page fetches only the 30 most-recent profiles for the heap trend (bounded `query()`), instead of loading and parsing the whole store — restoring the SQLite pushdown benefit on its own hot path.
  - **Persistence failures are logged** (previously swallowed silently). Bodies/log payloads with circular references or `BigInt` no longer crash the detail page or persistence (defensive serialization), and captured bodies are size-bounded via the new `maxBodySize` option.
  - **Robustness.** A failing custom HTTP instrumentation no longer aborts app bootstrap; a storage failure during a profiled CLI command no longer masks the command's own error.
  - **Asset cache-busting.** Profiler asset URLs carry a `?v=<version>` query so a package upgrade doesn't serve stale CSS/JS from browser/proxy caches.

- 9b1d8a1: Harden data capture and access control.

  - **Secret redaction everywhere.** A shared redaction utility (`redact`, exported from the core) now masks sensitive object keys (`password`, `token`, `apiKey`, DSN…) and credentials embedded in string values (URL userinfo `user:pass@`, JWTs, `sk-`/`pk-` keys, PEM blocks). It is applied to request headers (`maskHeaders`, default sensitive list — including the raw `cookie` header), config values (DSNs whose key is not itself sensitive, e.g. `DATABASE_URL`), the `@nestjs/config` `_PROCESS_ENV_VALIDATED` firehose is now dropped, SQL parameters (TypeORM/MikroORM), Mongo filters/pipelines, validator rejected values, RabbitMQ payloads, CLI arguments/options, session data, JWT claims and the auth user (now redacted recursively). The redaction sentinel is unified to `[REDACTED]`.
  - **`captureRequestBody` now defaults to `false`** (symmetry with `captureResponseBody`); captured bodies are redacted.
  - **No path traversal / token collisions.** The storage token is always an internal UUID; the client `x-request-id` header is kept only as a display-only `requestId` attribute. The file storage adapter additionally rejects any non-`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` token.
  - **Browser-usable access control.** `ProfilerGuard` now accepts the token via a `?token=` query parameter (not only `Authorization: Bearer`), exempts static assets under `__assets/*`, and compares tokens in constant time. Configuring a token no longer breaks the UI or the injected toolbar.
  - **Security headers** (`Cache-Control: no-store`, strict CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`) on the HTML pages and the JSON export; the `X-Debug-Token` headers can be disabled with `emitDebugHeaders: false`.

### Patch Changes

- 9b1d8a1: Fix two release blockers.

  - **http**: the package no longer references `@nestjs/axios` at all (no import, no lazy `require`). Installing `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http` never touches the peer, so a "bring your own client" (fetch/undici/got) setup can't crash at import. To instrument axios you now hand the collector your `HttpService.axiosRef` via `HttpCollectorModule.forRootAsync({ inject: [HttpService], useFactory: (http) => ({ axiosRef: http.axiosRef }) })`; the axios adapter no-ops when no `axiosRef` is provided.
  - **core**: the injected toolbar now loads a dedicated, preflight-free stylesheet (`toolbar.css`) scoped under `#profiler-toolbar`, instead of the full `profiler.css`. Tailwind's universal preflight reset is no longer applied to profiled host pages, so enabling the toolbar no longer breaks the host application's layout.

## 1.0.0-alpha.7

### Patch Changes

- e5464e6: Ship the profiler UI's browser behaviour as compiled, same-origin JavaScript bundles instead of inline template scripts, and make the client layer extensible.

  - All authored client behaviour (theme toggle, syntax highlighting, copy-to-clipboard, filter forms, tab switching) now lives in TypeScript, is bundled at build time, and is served under `/_profiler/__assets/scripts/*`. The HTML templates carry no inline `<script>` blocks and no `on*` attributes, so a strict `script-src 'self'` Content-Security-Policy works out of the box.
  - New `window.NestProfiler` browser runtime (`onReady`, `delegate`, `copyText`, `highlight`) that other bundles reuse — the only cross-bundle contract.
  - New `ClientAssetRegistry` service (exported, with `CORE_CLIENT_SCRIPT` and the `ClientAssetRegistration` type): a package shipping its own collector can register a client bundle so the profiler serves it and injects its `<script>` after `profiler.js`.
  - `nest-profiler-http`: the HTTP Client panel's request-row expand/collapse behaviour moves out of inline template handlers into a compiled `http.js` bundle registered automatically via `ClientAssetRegistry` — a reference implementation of the pattern. No consumer-facing change.

## 1.0.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- 8516122: Add Symfony-style "copy" buttons to the profiler UI so captured operations can be replayed in one click.

  - `nest-profiler`: copy the incoming HTTP request as a runnable `curl` command, and copy each SQL query with its bound parameters inlined (supports both `$N` Postgres/TypeORM and `?` MySQL/MikroORM placeholders). Exposes `buildCurlCommand` and `interpolateSql`.
  - `nest-profiler-http`: copy each outgoing HTTP client request as `curl`.
  - `nest-profiler-mongoose`: copy each query as a runnable `mongosh` command; aggregation pipelines are now captured so `aggregate` copies are complete.
  - `nest-profiler-rabbitmq`: copy the message payload and a ready-to-run amqplib `channel.publish(...)` snippet.

### Patch Changes

- d34fefe: Update supported peer dependency ranges and test dependencies for current NestJS 11-compatible releases, including `nestjs-cls` 6, Mongoose 9, and TypeORM 1.

## 1.0.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- Version bump only — released in lockstep with `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler` to keep the suite on a single version (Changesets `fixed` group). No functional changes to this package.

## 1.0.0-alpha.4

### Major Changes

- 2b0e626: Make HTTP-client profiling client-agnostic and rename the axios package.

  BREAKING: `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-axios` is renamed to `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http`, which is now client-agnostic. The old package is kept as a deprecated re-export shim and will be removed in a future release.
  - `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http` now owns the full HTTP-client contract: the `HttpRequestEntry` type, the `HttpClientCollector` + panel, the injectable `HttpProfilerRecorder`, the low-level `appendHttpRequestEntry(cls, entry)` helper, the redaction helpers (`DEFAULT_MASK_HEADERS` / `extractHeaders` / `formatHeaderValue`), and a pluggable `HttpInstrumentation` interface. The core `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler` is unchanged and stays HTTP-agnostic.
  - axios is now one **instrumentation** (`AxiosInstrumentation`) among others, enabled by default and no-op when `@nestjs/axios` is absent. Any client (fetch, undici, got, custom) feeds the same panel by injecting `HttpProfilerRecorder` or by registering a custom `HttpInstrumentation`.
  - The module is renamed `AxiosCollectorModule` → `HttpCollectorModule`; `forRoot()` accepts `axios`, `instrumentations` and the shared `HttpCaptureOptions`. `AxiosCollectorModule` remains exported from the deprecated shim as an alias.
  - The collector panel id / storage key is now `http-client` (was `axios`): stored data moves from `profile.collectors['axios']` to `profile.collectors['http-client']`.

  Migrate by installing `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http` and replacing `AxiosCollectorModule` with `HttpCollectorModule` (same options). Keep `HttpModule` from `@nestjs/axios` in the same module to use the axios adapter.

> Renamed from `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-axios`. Earlier entries below predate the rename.

## 1.0.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- Version bump only — released in lockstep with `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler` to keep the suite on a single version (Changesets `fixed` group). No functional changes to this package.

  - @eleven-labs/nest-profiler@1.0.0-alpha.1

## 0.5.1-alpha.0

### Patch Changes

- ff89de2: First public npm (alpha) release. `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-axios` is the HTTP-client collector for `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`:
  - Captures outgoing HTTP requests made through the `@nestjs/axios` `HttpService` (method, URL, status code, duration).
  - Displays them in the **HTTP Client** panel with per-request timing bars and a collapsible Request/Response headers + body detail (JSON syntax highlighting).
  - Capture options: `captureRequestHeaders` (default `true`), `captureRequestBody` (default `true` for non-GET/HEAD), `captureResponseHeaders` (default `true`), `captureResponseBody` (default `false`).
  - Automatic masking of sensitive headers (`authorization`, `cookie`, `set-cookie`, `x-api-key`, `x-auth-token`, `proxy-authorization`), extendable via `maskHeaders`.
  - Request-count badge with error highlighting (e.g. `3 (1 err)`); idempotent instrumentation (`__profilerPatched`) so requests are never recorded twice.
  - `enabled` option (no-op providers when `false`) and `AxiosCollectorModule.forRoot()`; optional peer dependencies on `@nestjs/axios` and `axios`.

- Updated dependencies [ff89de2]
