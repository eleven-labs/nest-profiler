/**
 * Contract for a section on the profiler list page (`/_profiler`).
 *
 * The list page groups the captured profiles into independent tables — one per
 * section — so different kinds of profiles can show their own columns. The core
 * ships the built-in "HTTP" catch-all section, and any package can contribute its
 * own — e.g. `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-graphql` adds a "GraphQL" table and
 * `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-commander` a "Commands" table — without touching
 * the core.
 *
 * Each profile is assigned to exactly one section: the first non-default
 * section (by ascending {@link order}) whose {@link matches} returns `true`,
 * otherwise the single {@link isDefault} section. Empty non-default sections are
 * hidden; the default section is always shown.
 *
 * A section renders its rows through its own EJS partial ({@link templatePath}),
 * which receives `{ profiles, profilerPath }` plus the shared template helpers
 * (`methodClass`, `statusClass`, `gqlTypeClass`, `isoDate`, `toJson`, …).
 *
 * Contribute one via the {@link PROFILER_LIST_SECTIONS} multi-token or by
 * calling {@link ProfilerCoreService.registerListSection} from a module's
 * `onModuleInit` (the cross-module path used by the protocol packages).
