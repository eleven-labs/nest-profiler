## 1.0.0-alpha.17

### Major Changes

- 46a05ab: Name the Discover contract after **Discover**, and RabbitMQ after **RabbitMQ**.

  Two naming inconsistencies had survived the move to per-transport Discover views. The extension point was still called `Route*` while three of its four sources contribute no routes at all — a CLI command, a GraphQL field and a message handler are not routes — and the publish panel was labelled **AMQP** next to a **RabbitMQ** list section, a **RabbitMQ** detail tab and a **RabbitMQ** Discover view, so one broker carried two names.

  Discover contract (core, and every source implementing it):

  - `ProfilerRouteSource` → `ProfilerDiscoverSource`, `RouteGroup` → `DiscoverGroup`, `RouteEntry` → `DiscoverEntry`, `RouteInputs` / `RouteInputGroup` / `RouteInputItem` → `DiscoverInputs` / `DiscoverInputGroup` / `DiscoverInputItem`, `RouteDtoInfo` / `RouteDtoProperty` → `DiscoverDtoInfo` / `DiscoverDtoProperty`.
  - `ProfilerCoreService.registerRouteSource()` → `registerDiscoverSource()`, `getRouteSources()` → `getDiscoverSources()`.
  - `DiscoverGroup.routes` → `DiscoverGroup.entries`, and `RoutesCollectorData.routeCount` → `entryCount`.
  - The shipped sources follow: `HttpRouteSource` → `HttpDiscoverSource`, `GraphqlRouteSource` → `GraphqlDiscoverSource`, `RabbitMqRouteSource` → `RabbitMqDiscoverSource`, `CommanderRouteSource` → `CommanderDiscoverSource`.

  `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-routes`, `RoutesCollectorModule` and `RoutesCollector` keep their names — the package still ships the built-in HTTP source and owns the panel — as does `RouteCollector`, the core's HTTP route matcher, which is unrelated to Discover.

  RabbitMQ naming:

  - The publish panel is labelled **RabbitMQ** instead of **AMQP**, and its rule domain is `rabbitmq` instead of `amqp`, so a chatty profile reads `12 rabbitmq calls in one request`. The core's per-domain defaults (`chattyThreshold`, the N+1 subject) move with it.
  - `AmqpPublishEntry` → `RabbitMqPublishEntry`. Internals follow suit (`AmqpPublishPatch` → `RabbitMqPublishPatch`, `buildAmqpPublish` → `buildRabbitMqPublish`), and the remaining prose says "RabbitMQ" where it used to say "AMQP", keeping the term only where it names the wire protocol itself.

  BREAKING: every renamed symbol above is a published export. No behaviour changes — a consumer importing one updates the import name, and a custom `ProfilerDiscoverSource` renames its `routes` field to `entries`. Nothing in the `?view=` keys, the storage format or the module options changes.

## 1.0.0-alpha.16

### Major Changes

- 0044e45: Stop collecting a command's exit code.

  **BREAKING:** `CommandInfo.exitCode` is removed, and the **Command** tab no longer shows an _Exit Code_ card. The field was never observed — the collector wraps `run()` from inside the process, so it cannot know the code the CLI eventually exits with; it was derived as `error ? 1 : 0`, saying exactly what `success` already said. Read `entrypoint.data.success`, or the profile's `response.statusCode` (`200` / `500`), instead.

### Minor Changes

- 0044e45: Describe non-HTTP route inputs with their own labels in the Routes panel, instead of borrowing **Query params**.

  **Core:** `RouteInputs` gains a `groups?: RouteInputGroup[]` field — a list of `{ label, items }` sections whose items are `{ name, description?, required?, defaultValue? }` — and `RouteEntry` gains an optional `description`. Both new types (`RouteInputGroup`, `RouteInputItem`) are exported. The panel renders each group as its own titled section (documented items as a name/description list, bare names as chips) and the route description above the inputs.

  **Commander:** the **Commands** group now lists each command's description (from `@Command({ description })`), its positional **Arguments** (split from `@Command({ arguments })`, documented via `argsDescription`, `<required>` marked) and its **Options** (from `@Option()`, with the description, default value and required marker) — previously only the long `--flag` names, mislabelled as _Query params_. Short-only options such as `-q` are now listed too, with their full flags string as the displayed name.

  **GraphQL:** field arguments now render under an **Arguments** label, and a field's schema description is surfaced on the route.

  The Commands list no longer prints `exit 0` next to the `OK` status — the status already says it. The exit code remains on the **Command** detail tab.

### Patch Changes

- 74d8986: Replace the single **Routes** panel with one **Discover** view per transport.

  "Routes" named the panel after one transport's vocabulary while listing four, and answered a question nobody asks that way: you look up the HTTP table, or the CLI's commands, not "all routes". Each registered `ProfilerRouteSource` now contributes its own sidebar view under a **Discover** heading — `Discover / HTTP`, `Discover / GraphQL`, `Discover / Commands`, `Discover / RabbitMQ` — each rendering that transport's table flat, with no group disclosure to open first, and counting its entries with the source's own noun (`4 commands`, `9 fields`). A transport that discovered nothing gets no view, so the sidebar lists only what the application actually registered.

  The `routes.png` screenshot is renamed `discover.png` and reshot on the HTTP view. The views are ordered deterministically — the built-in HTTP source first, then the other transports by label — instead of following the DI bootstrap order, which shuffled the sidebar between runs. They are keyed `discover-<transport>` in `?view=`, so they can never collide with the same-protocol profile list: `?view=graphql` stays the GraphQL list, `?view=discover-graphql` is its routing table. `discoverViewKey()`, `DISCOVER_GROUP` and `DISCOVER_GROUP_LABEL` are exported for consumers building their own links. The GraphQL, RabbitMQ and Commands sources declare the `itemLabel` their entries deserve; nothing else changes in how a source is registered.

- 1afa95c: Profile a command that fails before its `run()` is entered. The collector only wrapped `CommandRunner.run()`, but nest-commander evaluates the `@Option()` value parsers while commander parses the argv — i.e. before the action handler — so a parser that rejects its input (`throw new Error('Unknown site parameter')`) aborted the invocation outside the wrapper and the failed command left **no profile at all**: nothing in the Commands list, nothing under the Status "Failed" filter, while the same command succeeding was profiled normally.

  - Each `@Option()` value parser is now wrapped as well: a parser that throws produces a failed command profile (`success: false`, status `500`) carrying the thrown error in the **Exceptions** tab, then the error is rethrown untouched so the CLI behaves exactly as before.
  - Such a profile records the options commander had resolved so far (declared defaults included) plus the **raw** value the rejected flag was given — no parsed value exists for it — and empty `arguments`, since commander assigns the positional operands only once every option has parsed.
  - Persistence goes through the core's deferred queue (`schedulePersist`), drained on application shutdown, because commander's parse phase is synchronous and cannot await a save.

  Commander's own argv errors — an unknown option, a missing required option, an invalid `choices` value, or a parser throwing commander's `InvalidArgumentError` — still leave no profile: commander prints a CLI error and calls `process.exit()` itself, so nothing survives to persist one. This is now documented in the package README and in the troubleshooting guide.

- 1afa95c: Drop the explainers appended to the **Arguments** and **Options** headings of the Command tab. They restated the runner signature (`— positional operands (run(passedParams))`, `— parsed --flags (run(_, options))`) on every profile, competing with the values below them; the two headings now read `Arguments` and `Options`. What each one holds is documented on the package page, not repeated in the panel.
- 74d8986: Make the home page's sidebar identical to a profile's, and give each subject exactly one glyph.

  The two navigations had drifted into two components: the home page indented its items further (`pl-6` against the detail page's `pl-3`), used a thinner separator and its own header padding, rendered a flat count badge where the detail page accents the active one, and carried no icon at all on the **Profiling** items. Both now share one nav-item partial — same padding, same badge scale, same active accent — and both render the icon in a fixed-width slot, so an item that declares no icon still lines its label up with the others.

  `ProfilerListSection` gains an optional `icon`. A protocol now keeps **one** glyph everywhere it is named, across both pages: the HTTP globe is defined once in the core (exported as `HTTP_ICON`) and used by the HTTP list section, the HTTP routing table and the HTTP Client collector panel; the GraphQL mark serves both the GraphQL list section and the GraphQL detail tab. That retires two near-duplicate marks — a second terminal glyph for Commands and a second GraphQL glyph — which existed only because each file defined its own copy. Tabs naming a _content_ rather than a protocol (Request, Response, Message, Performance…) keep their own icon.

  The HTTP routing table is labelled **HTTP** rather than **REST**, so the sidebar names the protocol once: `Profiling / HTTP` and `Discover / HTTP`, same word, same globe. `RouteGroup.label` for the built-in source changes accordingly; the `?view=discover-http` key is unchanged.

## 1.0.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- 1735b38: Document the `@alpha` install tag in every package README.

  - Install commands now pin `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler*` packages to the `@alpha` dist-tag, since there is no stable release yet (`@latest` resolves to nothing).
  - Added a short note next to each install snippet explaining the requirement.

## 1.0.0-alpha.9

### Minor Changes

- 6ce7e47: Define what counts as an **error**, per package (breaking).

  "Error" had one hardcoded meaning: any status ≥ 400, plus any captured exception, always `danger`. But a `404` is a bug for one team and an ordinary answer for another, and a status code means nothing to GraphQL, RabbitMQ or a CLI command. Each entrypoint kind now carries its own definition, and you can redefine it — the `error` tag, its pills and the list's **Errors** checkbox all follow. See [What counts as an error](https://nestjs-profiler-module.vercel.app/en/docs/packages/nest-profiler/error-classification).

  **BREAKING — 4xx are no longer errors.** The default is now a status ≥ 500, or a captured exception when no status was recorded. Profiles previously tagged `error` for a `401`/`403`/`404` no longer are, and the **Errors** checkbox no longer keeps them. Restore the old behaviour with `ProfilerModule.forRoot({ error: { httpStatus: 400 } })`. The same shift applies to **outgoing HTTP calls** (`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http`): a call is failed when it threw or answered ≥ 500 — restore with `HttpCollectorModule.forRoot({ error: { httpStatus: 400 } })`.

  The layers resolve in order, first decisive: `classify` (tri-state — return `undefined` to defer) → `httpStatus`, which when a status is present decides **on its own** → `exceptions`, the fallback for kinds without a status. Layer 2 being decisive is what keeps the defaults coherent: a `NotFoundException` produces both an exception and a `404`, so consulting the exceptions too would contradict the status and re-flag the very 404 you excluded.

  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`** — new `error` option on `ProfilerModule.forRoot()` governing the built-in `http` kind. `ProfilerEntrypointType` gains `isError`/`errorSeverity` (a kind's verdict) and `hiddenFilters` (universal filters it drops from its list). `TagConfig` gains `isErrorEntry`/`errorSeverity`, so `error` is finally severity-configurable like the five other built-in tags. New exports: `resolveProfileErrorClassifier`, `resolveEntryErrorClassifier`, `resolveErrorSeverity`, `buildHttpEntrypointType`, and the `ProfilerErrorOptions`/`EntryErrorOptions`/`ProfileErrorInfo` types. `analyzeProfile()` takes an optional 4th argument carrying the kind's verdict (existing calls keep working; without it, only entries can be errors).
  - **New `Exception` list filter** — narrows to one failure type, with options built from the values actually captured (no configuration). It complements the **Errors** checkbox rather than duplicating it: `Errors` asks "what failed, per my definition", `Exception` asks "show me the `NotFoundException`s", whether or not they count as failures. Backed by a new universal `exception` index attribute (the primary exception's code, else its class name).
  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-graphql`** — new `error` option. A GraphQL response is `200` even when the operation failed, so statuses are ignored and `extensions.code` takes their role: only `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` counts by default, plus errors carrying no code. `BAD_USER_INPUT`/`UNAUTHENTICATED`/`NOT_FOUND` are the schema answering correctly. **BREAKING:** `GraphQLCollectorModuleOptions` moved to a dedicated entrypoint (still exported from the package root) and the module now follows the `ConfigurableModuleBuilder` pattern of every other collector, gaining `forRootAsync()`. `ExceptionEntry` gains `code`, populated from `extensions.code` instead of being buried in the `stack` string.
  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-rabbitmq`** — new `error` option. A message has no status, so the default is "the handler threw"; narrow it with `error: { exceptions: ['TimeoutError'] }` when a handler throws as flow control.
  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-commander`** — a non-zero exit is a failure, and that needs no configuration. The Commands list now hides the **Errors** checkbox, its `Status: Success/Failed` filter already asking exactly that.
  - The **Errors** checkbox was labelled `With errors`; it is now `Errors`, aligned with the other filter labels (`Status`, `Method`, `Exception`). The query parameter (`<section>_error`) is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- a3ba8ee: Make the profiler-UI tables horizontally scrollable on narrow/mobile viewports (fixes #184).

  Every list-section table (HTTP, GraphQL, Command, RabbitMQ) and several collector-panel tables (schema, timeline, routes, cache, validator) were wrapped in an `overflow-hidden` container (there to clip the rounded corners), which also clipped horizontal overflow with no scrollbar — so on a phone the wide tables were squished and the right-hand columns became unreachable. Each wide table now sits in an `overflow-x-auto` container with a sensible `min-w`, so a table too wide to fit scrolls horizontally within its own card (rounded corners preserved) while the page body itself never scrolls sideways.

## 1.0.0-alpha.8

### Minor Changes

- 9b1d8a1: Public API and packaging cleanup before the stable release (breaking).

  - **GraphQL module renamed** for ecosystem consistency: `ProfilerGraphQLModule` → `GraphQLCollectorModule` and `ProfilerGraphQLModuleOptions` → `GraphQLCollectorModuleOptions` (all 11 other collectors already use `XxxCollectorModule`). No alias — update imports.
  - **`PROFILER_CONTEXT_ADAPTERS` removed** from the public API. It was never consumed by the core; the single supported way to register a context adapter is `ProfilerCoreService.registerContextAdapter(adapter)` from your module's `onModuleInit` (resolve the core with `moduleRef.get(ProfilerCoreService, { strict: false })`). The dead multi-token providers in the GraphQL and RabbitMQ modules are gone.
  - **Named ORM connections supported.** `TypeOrm`/`Mongoose`/`MikroOrm` collector options gain a `connectionName?: string`; the (optionally named) connection is injected by its resolved token, optionally, so a named-only setup no longer crashes at bootstrap and a missing connection warns instead. A `getRequest()` on context adapters lets the interceptor repose the transport request in CLS (fixes GraphQL requests showing as anonymous in the Security panel).
  - **Peer dependencies tightened.** The core peer on every collector is bounded (`>=1.0.0-alpha.7 <2.0.0`) instead of an unbounded `>=`. Optional peers (`axios`, `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq`, `amqplib`, `@nestjs/graphql`, `class-validator`, `class-transformer`) are now declared in `peerDependencies` with ranges (plus `optional: true` in meta). `nest-profiler-http` no longer peer-depends on `@nestjs/axios` (it never imports it — you provide `axiosRef` via `forRootAsync`); `nest-profiler-commander` now declares `nest-commander` as a **required** peer (imported statically) rather than optional. ORM peer ranges widened to cover the installed base: `typeorm ">=0.3.20 <2.0.0"`, `mongoose "^8 || ^9"`. `nest-profiler-mikro-orm` requires Node `>=22.12.0` (stable `require(esm)`).
  - **Misc.** A throwing custom validator extractor can no longer turn a 400 into a 500; the RabbitMQ adapter's options are `@Optional()`; the dead `COMMANDER_COLLECTOR_OPTIONS` token is removed; the RabbitMQ package builds via the shared `repo-build`. `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq` is now a dev dependency.

- 9b1d8a1: Reliability fixes across the profiler.

  - **Correct HTTP error status.** A non-`HttpException` thrown from a handler is now recorded as `500` instead of a stale `200`, matching the non-HTTP path.
  - **Disabling the profiler no longer removes validation.** `ValidatorCollectorModule.forRoot({ enabled: false })` still installs the bare validation pipe (your `pipe` or the default class-validator one), just without profiling.
  - **GraphQL filters fixed.** `ignoreGraphQLIntrospection` no longer misclassifies the ubiquitous `__typename` meta-field as introspection (it matched `__type`), so real traffic is profiled again. `ignoreGraphQLPlayground` is now scoped to the GraphQL endpoint path (default `/graphql`, configurable via the new `createIgnoreGraphQLPlayground(path)`), so it no longer suppresses every HTML page of a mixed SSR + GraphQL app.
  - **Mongoose writes are captured.** `document.save()` / `Model.create()`, `insertMany()` and `bulkWrite()` now appear in the MongoDB panel (previously only `Query`/`Aggregate` reads were visible).
  - **Disabled core no longer crashes collectors.** Collectors resolve the core's global providers (`ClsService`, `ProfilerCoreService`, the ORM connection) lazily via `ModuleRef.get(token, { strict: false })` in `onModuleInit` and degrade to a no-op when they are absent, so `ProfilerModule.forRoot({ enabled: false })` / `ProfilerNoopModule` with a collector left enabled boots cleanly instead of failing DI. (A plain `@Optional()` dependency does not traverse to a global module from a dynamic feature module, so it could not be used here.) The HTTP `HttpProfilerRecorder` stays injectable (no-op) when disabled.
  - **Dashboard performance.** The list page fetches only the 30 most-recent profiles for the heap trend (bounded `query()`), instead of loading and parsing the whole store — restoring the SQLite pushdown benefit on its own hot path.
  - **Persistence failures are logged** (previously swallowed silently). Bodies/log payloads with circular references or `BigInt` no longer crash the detail page or persistence (defensive serialization), and captured bodies are size-bounded via the new `maxBodySize` option.
  - **Robustness.** A failing custom HTTP instrumentation no longer aborts app bootstrap; a storage failure during a profiled CLI command no longer masks the command's own error.
  - **Asset cache-busting.** Profiler asset URLs carry a `?v=<version>` query so a package upgrade doesn't serve stale CSS/JS from browser/proxy caches.

- a8a149b: Contribute **RabbitMQ** and **Commands** groups to the Routes panel (`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-routes`).

  - `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-rabbitmq`: `RabbitMqRouteSource` scans `@RabbitSubscribe` handlers (via the `RABBIT_HANDLER` metadata) and lists each consumer with its exchange, routing key and handler.
  - `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-commander`: `CommanderRouteSource` scans nest-commander `@Command()` classes and lists each command with its name, declaring class and `--option` flags.

  Both self-register a `ProfilerRouteSource` with the core at bootstrap, so they appear in the panel automatically when the Routes panel package is installed.

- 9b1d8a1: Harden data capture and access control.

  - **Secret redaction everywhere.** A shared redaction utility (`redact`, exported from the core) now masks sensitive object keys (`password`, `token`, `apiKey`, DSN…) and credentials embedded in string values (URL userinfo `user:pass@`, JWTs, `sk-`/`pk-` keys, PEM blocks). It is applied to request headers (`maskHeaders`, default sensitive list — including the raw `cookie` header), config values (DSNs whose key is not itself sensitive, e.g. `DATABASE_URL`), the `@nestjs/config` `_PROCESS_ENV_VALIDATED` firehose is now dropped, SQL parameters (TypeORM/MikroORM), Mongo filters/pipelines, validator rejected values, RabbitMQ payloads, CLI arguments/options, session data, JWT claims and the auth user (now redacted recursively). The redaction sentinel is unified to `[REDACTED]`.
  - **`captureRequestBody` now defaults to `false`** (symmetry with `captureResponseBody`); captured bodies are redacted.
  - **No path traversal / token collisions.** The storage token is always an internal UUID; the client `x-request-id` header is kept only as a display-only `requestId` attribute. The file storage adapter additionally rejects any non-`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` token.
  - **Browser-usable access control.** `ProfilerGuard` now accepts the token via a `?token=` query parameter (not only `Authorization: Bearer`), exempts static assets under `__assets/*`, and compares tokens in constant time. Configuring a token no longer breaks the UI or the injected toolbar.
  - **Security headers** (`Cache-Control: no-store`, strict CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`) on the HTML pages and the JSON export; the `X-Debug-Token` headers can be disabled with `emitDebugHeaders: false`.

## 1.0.0-alpha.7

### Minor Changes

- 157436f: Push list filtering and pagination down to the storage adapter, add server-side pagination and a SQLite backend, and make list filters/sections declarative.

  `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`:

  - **Server-side pagination**: each list section paginates independently via a `<sectionKey>_page` query param, with a Prev/Next pager. New `listPageSize` option (default `25`).
  - **Storage-level query pushdown**: new structured `ProfilerQuery` / `FilterCriterion` model and optional `query()` / `distinct()` methods on `IProfilerStorageAdapter`. `ProfilerStorageService` exposes `query()` / `distinct()` and, for adapters that don't implement them, falls back to an in-memory implementation over `findAll()` — so a query-capable store (a database, Redis…) can filter, sort, paginate and count natively instead of loading every profile. Exposes `ProfileSummary` / `summarizeProfile`, `applyQueryInMemory`, `selectPage`, `distinctFromSummaries`, `matchesCriterion` and `sectionTypeConstraint` to help build custom adapters.
  - **File storage**: the file adapter now filters/sorts/paginates over an in-memory `ProfileSummary` index persisted in a `_index.meta` sidecar, reading only the current page's `{token}.json` files; it implements the native `query()` / `distinct()` path.
  - **SQLite storage**: a new adapter under the `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler/sqlite` subpath (`better-sqlite3` as an optional peer dependency) stores each profile as an indexed summary row plus the full document and pushes queries down to SQL (`WHERE … ORDER BY … LIMIT/OFFSET` + `COUNT(*)`).
  - `maxProfiles` and `ttl` can now be **disabled** by passing `0` (or a negative value) — no cap / never expire — on every built-in adapter (the `100` / `3600` defaults are unchanged).
  - **BREAKING** — the list-filter and list-section extension API is now declarative so it can be pushed down:
    - `ProfilerListFilter.matches(profile, value)` is replaced by `toCriterion(value): FilterCriterion`; a dynamic `'select'`'s `optionsFor(profiles)` is replaced by `distinctField` (its options come from `storage.distinct()`).
    - `ProfilerListSection.matches(profile)` is removed; a section owns entrypoint `types` (defaulting to its `key`). `bucketProfilesBySection` and `ProfilerListSectionBucket` are removed in favour of `sectionTypeConstraint`.
    - `ProfilerEntrypointType` gains an optional `indexAttributes(profile)` projection so kind-specific facets are indexable and queryable.

  `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-graphql`, `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-rabbitmq`, `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-commander`:

  - Migrate the contributed list filters to the declarative `toCriterion` API and add each entrypoint type's `indexAttributes` projection (GraphQL `operationType`; RabbitMQ `exchange` / `routingKey` / `handler` / `redelivered`; command `success`), so these scoped filters push down to query-capable storage adapters.

## 1.0.0-alpha.6

### Patch Changes

- d34fefe: Update supported peer dependency ranges and test dependencies for current NestJS 11-compatible releases, including `nestjs-cls` 6, Mongoose 9, and TypeORM 1.

## 1.0.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- Version bump only — released in lockstep with `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler` to keep the suite on a single version (Changesets `fixed` group). No functional changes to this package.

## 1.0.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- 9523bad: Own the command profile shape and its UI instead of relying on core types.

  `CommandProfiler` now builds a `command` entrypoint (`entrypoint.type = 'command'`, the command details on `entrypoint.data`). The package exports its own `CommandInfo` type and `COMMAND_ENTRYPOINT_TYPE`, and `CommanderCollectorModule` registers a `command` entrypoint type with the profiler core — contributing the Commands list table, the **Command** detail tab and a **Status** (success / failed) filter above the Commands list. Import the module in your HTTP app too when you want command profiles produced by the CLI process (shared via file storage) to render in its web profiler.

## 1.0.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- Version bump only — released in lockstep with `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler` to keep the suite on a single version (Changesets `fixed` group). No functional changes to this package.

## 1.0.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [e4822c6]
  - @eleven-labs/nest-profiler@1.0.0-alpha.1

## 0.5.1-alpha.0

### Patch Changes

- ff89de2: First public npm (alpha) release. `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-commander` profiles CLI commands built with [nest-commander](https://nest-commander.jaymcdoniel.dev/) — the console equivalent of Symfony's command profiling:
  - Automatically profiles every nest-commander command, with no changes to your command classes.
  - Each run produces a profile (shown alongside HTTP profiles at `/_profiler`) with the command name, positional arguments, parsed options, duration, and exit code.
  - Runs the command body inside the profiler's CLS context, so other collectors (HTTP client, cache, database, …) capture the activity a command triggers.
  - Sets `request.command` so the UI renders commands in a dedicated **Commands** table and **Command** tab.
  - Exceptions thrown by a command are captured and the profile is marked as failed (HTTP-equivalent status `500`).
  - `enabled` option (no providers when `false`) and `CommanderCollectorModule.forRoot()`; optional peer dependency on `nest-commander` (no-op when absent).

- Updated dependencies [ff89de2]
  - @eleven-labs/nest-profiler@0.5.1-alpha.0
