### Minor Changes

- 5ea9463: Fill the trace waterfall with the work the collectors already capture.

  - `appendCollectorEntry()` — the single funnel every instrumentation in every package goes through — now stamps each entry with the trace span that was open when it was captured. The parent is therefore exact rather than inferred from overlapping time windows, which is what makes it right under concurrency: two calls fired together no longer nest under one another.
  - New `TraceContributor` implementations project already-collected entries onto the trace: every query collector (TypeORM, MikroORM, Mongoose) through `AbstractQueryCollector`, plus the HTTP-client and cache collectors. Nothing is re-timed — the shared `entriesToSpans()` helper reads the `startedAt`, `duration`, tags and parent each entry already carries.
  - Each bar links back to the row holding its detail, and a grouped collector links to its group panel (`database`) rather than to itself.
  - The HTTP collector classifies a failed bar with its own `error` option, so a 404 reddens only where the application says it should.
  - New exports: `entriesToSpans`, `EntrySpanOptions`. Entry interfaces gain `parentSpanId`.

### Patch Changes

- ec8aad8: Consolidate three sets of internals that had been copied across the workspace, and record exception causes.

  **Reading the active profile.** `readProfile`, `readToken`, `readRequest` and `setProfileContext` are the way to reach the profiling context. The CLS store was previously addressed by string literal in 24 places across ten packages, each with its own `try`/`catch` — and `PROFILER_CLS_KEYS`, which existed precisely to prevent that, was used almost nowhere. A mistyped key reads as `undefined` rather than failing, silently turning a collector into a no-op; the accessors remove the opportunity. `PROFILER_CLS_KEYS` also gains the `token` key it was missing while three packages wrote the literal.

  **Exception causes and codes.** `toExceptionEntry` replaces the four hand-rolled constructions of an `ExceptionEntry` (the interceptor's HTTP and non-HTTP paths, the catch-all exception filter, the command profiler), which had all drifted into recording only `name`, `message` and `stack`. Two things are now captured:

  - **`ExceptionEntry.cause`** — the `cause` chain of a wrapped error, recorded recursively to a bounded depth and cycle-safe. An `InternalServerErrorException` says nothing; the `QueryFailedError` underneath says everything. The Exceptions tab renders the chain as one `Caused by` block per level.
  - **`ExceptionEntry.code`** — a machine-readable code carried by the error (`ENOENT`, `ECONNREFUSED`, a driver's own), which the `exception` list filter groups by in preference to the class name.

  Coercion of a non-`Error` throw is deliberately unchanged, so existing profiles keep grouping under `Error`.

  **Shared collector options.** `CollectorModuleOptions` (the `enabled` flag, previously redeclared in twelve interfaces) and `TagSeverityOptions` (the tag severities, redeclared in five) are declared once in the core and extended by each collector's options interface. Only options whose meaning _and_ default are identical everywhere moved: the numeric thresholds stay per package, because a slow SQL query is 100 ms, a slow outgoing HTTP call 300 ms and a slow publish 50 ms — that default is the useful half of the documentation.

  No behaviour change and no configuration change: every option keeps its name, type and default, and the accessors return exactly what the code they replace returned.

## 1.0.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- 1735b38: Document the `@alpha` install tag in every package README.

  - Install commands now pin `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler*` packages to the `@alpha` dist-tag, since there is no stable release yet (`@latest` resolves to nothing).
  - Added a short note next to each install snippet explaining the requirement.

## 1.0.0-alpha.9

### Patch Changes

- a3ba8ee: Make the profiler-UI tables horizontally scrollable on narrow/mobile viewports (fixes #184).

  Every list-section table (HTTP, GraphQL, Command, RabbitMQ) and several collector-panel tables (schema, timeline, routes, cache, validator) were wrapped in an `overflow-hidden` container (there to clip the rounded corners), which also clipped horizontal overflow with no scrollbar — so on a phone the wide tables were squished and the right-hand columns became unreachable. Each wide table now sits in an `overflow-x-auto` container with a sensible `min-w`, so a table too wide to fit scrolls horizontally within its own card (rounded corners preserved) while the page body itself never scrolls sideways.

## 1.0.0-alpha.8

### Minor Changes

- 9b1d8a1: Reliability fixes across the profiler.

  - **Correct HTTP error status.** A non-`HttpException` thrown from a handler is now recorded as `500` instead of a stale `200`, matching the non-HTTP path.
  - **Disabling the profiler no longer removes validation.** `ValidatorCollectorModule.forRoot({ enabled: false })` still installs the bare validation pipe (your `pipe` or the default class-validator one), just without profiling.
  - **GraphQL filters fixed.** `ignoreGraphQLIntrospection` no longer misclassifies the ubiquitous `__typename` meta-field as introspection (it matched `__type`), so real traffic is profiled again. `ignoreGraphQLPlayground` is now scoped to the GraphQL endpoint path (default `/graphql`, configurable via the new `createIgnoreGraphQLPlayground(path)`), so it no longer suppresses every HTML page of a mixed SSR + GraphQL app.
  - **Mongoose writes are captured.** `document.save()` / `Model.create()`, `insertMany()` and `bulkWrite()` now appear in the MongoDB panel (previously only `Query`/`Aggregate` reads were visible).
  - **Disabled core no longer crashes collectors.** Collectors resolve the core's global providers (`ClsService`, `ProfilerCoreService`, the ORM connection) lazily via `ModuleRef.get(token, { strict: false })` in `onModuleInit` and degrade to a no-op when they are absent, so `ProfilerModule.forRoot({ enabled: false })` / `ProfilerNoopModule` with a collector left enabled boots cleanly instead of failing DI. (A plain `@Optional()` dependency does not traverse to a global module from a dynamic feature module, so it could not be used here.) The HTTP `HttpProfilerRecorder` stays injectable (no-op) when disabled.
  - **Dashboard performance.** The list page fetches only the 30 most-recent profiles for the heap trend (bounded `query()`), instead of loading and parsing the whole store — restoring the SQLite pushdown benefit on its own hot path.
  - **Persistence failures are logged** (previously swallowed silently). Bodies/log payloads with circular references or `BigInt` no longer crash the detail page or persistence (defensive serialization), and captured bodies are size-bounded via the new `maxBodySize` option.
  - **Robustness.** A failing custom HTTP instrumentation no longer aborts app bootstrap; a storage failure during a profiled CLI command no longer masks the command's own error.
  - **Asset cache-busting.** Profiler asset URLs carry a `?v=<version>` query so a package upgrade doesn't serve stale CSS/JS from browser/proxy caches.

### Patch Changes

- 9b1d8a1: Public API and packaging cleanup before the stable release (breaking).

  - **GraphQL module renamed** for ecosystem consistency: `ProfilerGraphQLModule` → `GraphQLCollectorModule` and `ProfilerGraphQLModuleOptions` → `GraphQLCollectorModuleOptions` (all 11 other collectors already use `XxxCollectorModule`). No alias — update imports.
  - **`PROFILER_CONTEXT_ADAPTERS` removed** from the public API. It was never consumed by the core; the single supported way to register a context adapter is `ProfilerCoreService.registerContextAdapter(adapter)` from your module's `onModuleInit` (resolve the core with `moduleRef.get(ProfilerCoreService, { strict: false })`). The dead multi-token providers in the GraphQL and RabbitMQ modules are gone.
  - **Named ORM connections supported.** `TypeOrm`/`Mongoose`/`MikroOrm` collector options gain a `connectionName?: string`; the (optionally named) connection is injected by its resolved token, optionally, so a named-only setup no longer crashes at bootstrap and a missing connection warns instead. A `getRequest()` on context adapters lets the interceptor repose the transport request in CLS (fixes GraphQL requests showing as anonymous in the Security panel).
  - **Peer dependencies tightened.** The core peer on every collector is bounded (`>=1.0.0-alpha.7 <2.0.0`) instead of an unbounded `>=`. Optional peers (`axios`, `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq`, `amqplib`, `@nestjs/graphql`, `class-validator`, `class-transformer`) are now declared in `peerDependencies` with ranges (plus `optional: true` in meta). `nest-profiler-http` no longer peer-depends on `@nestjs/axios` (it never imports it — you provide `axiosRef` via `forRootAsync`); `nest-profiler-commander` now declares `nest-commander` as a **required** peer (imported statically) rather than optional. ORM peer ranges widened to cover the installed base: `typeorm ">=0.3.20 <2.0.0"`, `mongoose "^8 || ^9"`. `nest-profiler-mikro-orm` requires Node `>=22.12.0` (stable `require(esm)`).
  - **Misc.** A throwing custom validator extractor can no longer turn a 400 into a 500; the RabbitMQ adapter's options are `@Optional()`; the dead `COMMANDER_COLLECTOR_OPTIONS` token is removed; the RabbitMQ package builds via the shared `repo-build`. `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq` is now a dev dependency.

- 9b1d8a1: Minor correctness and robustness fixes.

  - **Storage query parity** between the in-memory/file and SQLite backends: `contains` is now case-insensitive on both sides; LIKE wildcards (`%`, `_`) in a filter value are escaped (no false positives); results have a deterministic `token` tie-breaker so pagination is stable across equal timestamps; an empty `typeIn` consistently means "no type constraint".
  - **Memory adapter** no longer evicts the oldest profile when re-saving an existing token (e.g. the GraphQL backfill), which previously shrank the store below its cap.
  - **Storage lifecycle**: adapters may implement `close()`; the profiler calls it on shutdown after a **bounded** drain of pending saves (so a hung custom adapter can't block graceful shutdown), and the SQLite handle is closed/checkpointed.
  - **Route matching** escapes regex metacharacters and supports param constraints (`:id(\\d+)`) without throwing, and compiles each pattern once instead of per request.
  - **Cache collector** records failed cache operations (with an `error`) instead of dropping them, and restores the patched methods on module destroy.
  - **Robustness**: the config panel warns when it reads empty despite a `ConfigService` (canary on the private `internalConfig`); MikroORM re-evaluates the host's query-logging setting per call and surfaces the real error message; the `mongosh` copy command uses safe serialization; the HTTP-request detail template guards missing `query`/`headers`; the client copy button tolerates malformed base64 and escapes group ids with `CSS.escape`; interpolated SQL escapes backslashes.

  - Shows the cache key, operation type, and TTL per entry in the **Cache** panel, with a hit/miss ratio badge in the toolbar.
  - Idempotent instrumentation (`__profilerPatched`) so operations are never recorded twice.
  - `enabled` option — when `false`, registers no-op providers only (the host app owns the dev/prod decision).
  - `CacheCollectorModule.forRoot()` configuration.
