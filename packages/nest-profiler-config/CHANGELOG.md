# @eleven-labs/nest-profiler-config

## 1.0.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- 1735b38: Document the `@alpha` install tag in every package README.

  - Install commands now pin `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler*` packages to the `@alpha` dist-tag, since there is no stable release yet (`@latest` resolves to nothing).
  - Added a short note next to each install snippet explaining the requirement.

## 1.0.0-alpha.9

### Patch Changes

- Version bump only — released in lockstep with `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler` to keep the suite on a single version (Changesets `fixed` group). No functional changes to this package.

## 1.0.0-alpha.8

### Minor Changes

- 882e5ac: Add `forRootAsync` to every collector whose options are resolved at runtime, so masking, thresholds and capture flags can be driven from `ConfigService` (or any provider) instead of static literals.

  - New `forRootAsync({ imports?, inject?, useFactory })` on `TypeOrmCollectorModule`, `MongooseCollectorModule`, `MikroOrmCollectorModule`, `ConfigCollectorModule`, `AuthCollectorModule`, `RabbitMqCollectorModule` and `ValidatorCollectorModule`, mirroring the existing `HttpCollectorModule.forRootAsync`. Each package also exports a matching `*CollectorModuleAsyncOptions` type.
  - Collectors now share a `ConfigurableModuleBuilder`-based options token and a single `buildCollectorModule` helper (exported from `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`) that centralizes the synchronous `enabled: false` short-circuit — so disabling behaves consistently across every collector.
  - `enabled` stays a synchronous build-time flag (it decides which providers are registered, which an async factory cannot); per-environment gating remains the host's job via `ConditionalModule.registerWhen(...)`. `HttpCollectorModule` is refactored onto the shared builder with no change to its public API (`HTTP_COLLECTOR_OPTIONS`, `HTTP_INSTRUMENTATIONS`, `axios`/`instrumentations` and the `axiosRef` contract are preserved).
  - `cache`, `commander` and `graphql` are intentionally left `forRoot`-only: their sole option is `enabled`, which has nothing to resolve asynchronously.

- 9b1d8a1: Harden data capture and access control.

  - **Secret redaction everywhere.** A shared redaction utility (`redact`, exported from the core) now masks sensitive object keys (`password`, `token`, `apiKey`, DSN…) and credentials embedded in string values (URL userinfo `user:pass@`, JWTs, `sk-`/`pk-` keys, PEM blocks). It is applied to request headers (`maskHeaders`, default sensitive list — including the raw `cookie` header), config values (DSNs whose key is not itself sensitive, e.g. `DATABASE_URL`), the `@nestjs/config` `_PROCESS_ENV_VALIDATED` firehose is now dropped, SQL parameters (TypeORM/MikroORM), Mongo filters/pipelines, validator rejected values, RabbitMQ payloads, CLI arguments/options, session data, JWT claims and the auth user (now redacted recursively). The redaction sentinel is unified to `[REDACTED]`.
  - **`captureRequestBody` now defaults to `false`** (symmetry with `captureResponseBody`); captured bodies are redacted.
  - **No path traversal / token collisions.** The storage token is always an internal UUID; the client `x-request-id` header is kept only as a display-only `requestId` attribute. The file storage adapter additionally rejects any non-`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` token.
  - **Browser-usable access control.** `ProfilerGuard` now accepts the token via a `?token=` query parameter (not only `Authorization: Bearer`), exempts static assets under `__assets/*`, and compares tokens in constant time. Configuring a token no longer breaks the UI or the injected toolbar.
  - **Security headers** (`Cache-Control: no-store`, strict CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`) on the HTML pages and the JSON export; the `X-Debug-Token` headers can be disabled with `emitDebugHeaders: false`.

### Patch Changes

- 9b1d8a1: Public API and packaging cleanup before the stable release (breaking).

  - **GraphQL module renamed** for ecosystem consistency: `ProfilerGraphQLModule` → `GraphQLCollectorModule` and `ProfilerGraphQLModuleOptions` → `GraphQLCollectorModuleOptions` (all 11 other collectors already use `XxxCollectorModule`). No alias — update imports.
  - **`PROFILER_CONTEXT_ADAPTERS` removed** from the public API. It was never consumed by the core; the single supported way to register a context adapter is `ProfilerCoreService.registerContextAdapter(adapter)` from your module's `onModuleInit` (resolve the core with `moduleRef.get(ProfilerCoreService, { strict: false })`). The dead multi-token providers in the GraphQL and RabbitMQ modules are gone.
  - **Named ORM connections supported.** `TypeOrm`/`Mongoose`/`MikroOrm` collector options gain a `connectionName?: string`; the (optionally named) connection is injected by its resolved token, optionally, so a named-only setup no longer crashes at bootstrap and a missing connection warns instead. A `getRequest()` on context adapters lets the interceptor repose the transport request in CLS (fixes GraphQL requests showing as anonymous in the Security panel).
  - **Peer dependencies tightened.** The core peer on every collector is bounded (`>=1.0.0-alpha.7 <2.0.0`) instead of an unbounded `>=`. Optional peers (`axios`, `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq`, `amqplib`, `@nestjs/graphql`, `class-validator`, `class-transformer`) are now declared in `peerDependencies` with ranges (plus `optional: true` in meta). `nest-profiler-http` no longer peer-depends on `@nestjs/axios` (it never imports it — you provide `axiosRef` via `forRootAsync`); `nest-profiler-commander` now declares `nest-commander` as a **required** peer (imported statically) rather than optional. ORM peer ranges widened to cover the installed base: `typeorm ">=0.3.20 <2.0.0"`, `mongoose "^8 || ^9"`. `nest-profiler-mikro-orm` requires Node `>=22.12.0` (stable `require(esm)`).
  - **Misc.** A throwing custom validator extractor can no longer turn a 400 into a 500; the RabbitMQ adapter's options are `@Optional()`; the dead `COMMANDER_COLLECTOR_OPTIONS` token is removed; the RabbitMQ package builds via the shared `repo-build`. `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq` is now a dev dependency.

- 9b1d8a1: Minor correctness and robustness fixes.

  - **Storage query parity** between the in-memory/file and SQLite backends: `contains` is now case-insensitive on both sides; LIKE wildcards (`%`, `_`) in a filter value are escaped (no false positives); results have a deterministic `token` tie-breaker so pagination is stable across equal timestamps; an empty `typeIn` consistently means "no type constraint".
  - **Memory adapter** no longer evicts the oldest profile when re-saving an existing token (e.g. the GraphQL backfill), which previously shrank the store below its cap.
  - **Storage lifecycle**: adapters may implement `close()`; the profiler calls it on shutdown after a **bounded** drain of pending saves (so a hung custom adapter can't block graceful shutdown), and the SQLite handle is closed/checkpointed.
  - **Route matching** escapes regex metacharacters and supports param constraints (`:id(\\d+)`) without throwing, and compiles each pattern once instead of per request.
  - **Cache collector** records failed cache operations (with an `error`) instead of dropping them, and restores the patched methods on module destroy.
  - **Robustness**: the config panel warns when it reads empty despite a `ConfigService` (canary on the private `internalConfig`); MikroORM re-evaluates the host's query-logging setting per call and surfaces the real error message; the `mongosh` copy command uses safe serialization; the HTTP-request detail template guards missing `query`/`headers`; the client copy button tolerates malformed base64 and escapes group ids with `CSS.escape`; interpolated SQL escapes backslashes.

### Patch Changes

- ff89de2: First public npm (alpha) release. `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-config` is the `@nestjs/config` collector for `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`:
  - Captures a flattened snapshot of the `ConfigService` configuration at application bootstrap.
  - Global collector — appears on the profiles list and on every profile detail view, in the **Config** panel.
  - Secret/sensitive-key masking via `maskKeys` (dot-notation supported, e.g. `database.password`); masked values shown as `***`.
  - `enabled` option — when `false`, registers no-op providers only (the host app owns the dev/prod decision).
  - `ConfigCollectorModule.forRoot()` configuration.
