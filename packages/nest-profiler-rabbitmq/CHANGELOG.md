# @eleven-labs/nest-profiler-rabbitmq

## 1.0.0-alpha.11

### Patch Changes

- Version bump only — released in lockstep with `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler` to keep the suite on a single version (Changesets `fixed` group). No functional changes to this package.

## 1.0.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- 1735b38: Document the `@alpha` install tag in every package README.

  - Install commands now pin `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler*` packages to the `@alpha` dist-tag, since there is no stable release yet (`@latest` resolves to nothing).
  - Added a short note next to each install snippet explaining the requirement.

## 1.0.0-alpha.9

### Minor Changes

- 6ce7e47: Define what counts as an **error**, per package (breaking).

  "Error" had one hardcoded meaning: any status ≥ 400, plus any captured exception, always `danger`. But a `404` is a bug for one team and an ordinary answer for another, and a status code means nothing to GraphQL, RabbitMQ or a CLI command. Each entrypoint kind now carries its own definition, and you can redefine it — the `error` tag, its pills and the list's **Errors** checkbox all follow. See [What counts as an error](https://nestjs-profiler-module.vercel.app/en/docs/packages/nest-profiler/error-classification).

  **BREAKING — 4xx are no longer errors.** The default is now a status ≥ 500, or a captured exception when no status was recorded. Profiles previously tagged `error` for a `401`/`403`/`404` no longer are, and the **Errors** checkbox no longer keeps them. Restore the old behaviour with `ProfilerModule.forRoot({ error: { httpStatus: 400 } })`. The same shift applies to **outgoing HTTP calls** (`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-http`): a call is failed when it threw or answered ≥ 500 — restore with `HttpCollectorModule.forRoot({ error: { httpStatus: 400 } })`.

  The layers resolve in order, first decisive: `classify` (tri-state — return `undefined` to defer) → `httpStatus`, which when a status is present decides **on its own** → `exceptions`, the fallback for kinds without a status. Layer 2 being decisive is what keeps the defaults coherent: a `NotFoundException` produces both an exception and a `404`, so consulting the exceptions too would contradict the status and re-flag the very 404 you excluded.

  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`** — new `error` option on `ProfilerModule.forRoot()` governing the built-in `http` kind. `ProfilerEntrypointType` gains `isError`/`errorSeverity` (a kind's verdict) and `hiddenFilters` (universal filters it drops from its list). `TagConfig` gains `isErrorEntry`/`errorSeverity`, so `error` is finally severity-configurable like the five other built-in tags. New exports: `resolveProfileErrorClassifier`, `resolveEntryErrorClassifier`, `resolveErrorSeverity`, `buildHttpEntrypointType`, and the `ProfilerErrorOptions`/`EntryErrorOptions`/`ProfileErrorInfo` types. `analyzeProfile()` takes an optional 4th argument carrying the kind's verdict (existing calls keep working; without it, only entries can be errors).
  - **New `Exception` list filter** — narrows to one failure type, with options built from the values actually captured (no configuration). It complements the **Errors** checkbox rather than duplicating it: `Errors` asks "what failed, per my definition", `Exception` asks "show me the `NotFoundException`s", whether or not they count as failures. Backed by a new universal `exception` index attribute (the primary exception's code, else its class name).
  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-graphql`** — new `error` option. A GraphQL response is `200` even when the operation failed, so statuses are ignored and `extensions.code` takes their role: only `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` counts by default, plus errors carrying no code. `BAD_USER_INPUT`/`UNAUTHENTICATED`/`NOT_FOUND` are the schema answering correctly. **BREAKING:** `GraphQLCollectorModuleOptions` moved to a dedicated entrypoint (still exported from the package root) and the module now follows the `ConfigurableModuleBuilder` pattern of every other collector, gaining `forRootAsync()`. `ExceptionEntry` gains `code`, populated from `extensions.code` instead of being buried in the `stack` string.
  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-rabbitmq`** — new `error` option. A message has no status, so the default is "the handler threw"; narrow it with `error: { exceptions: ['TimeoutError'] }` when a handler throws as flow control.
  - **`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-commander`** — a non-zero exit is a failure, and that needs no configuration. The Commands list now hides the **Errors** checkbox, its `Status: Success/Failed` filter already asking exactly that.
  - The **Errors** checkbox was labelled `With errors`; it is now `Errors`, aligned with the other filter labels (`Status`, `Method`, `Exception`). The query parameter (`<section>_error`) is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- a3ba8ee: Make the profiler-UI tables horizontally scrollable on narrow/mobile viewports (fixes #184).

  Every list-section table (HTTP, GraphQL, Command, RabbitMQ) and several collector-panel tables (schema, timeline, routes, cache, validator) were wrapped in an `overflow-hidden` container (there to clip the rounded corners), which also clipped horizontal overflow with no scrollbar — so on a phone the wide tables were squished and the right-hand columns became unreachable. Each wide table now sits in an `overflow-x-auto` container with a sensible `min-w`, so a table too wide to fit scrolls horizontally within its own card (rounded corners preserved) while the page body itself never scrolls sideways.

## 1.0.0-alpha.8

### Minor Changes

- 9b1d8a1: Public API and packaging cleanup before the stable release (breaking).

  - **GraphQL module renamed** for ecosystem consistency: `ProfilerGraphQLModule` → `GraphQLCollectorModule` and `ProfilerGraphQLModuleOptions` → `GraphQLCollectorModuleOptions` (all 11 other collectors already use `XxxCollectorModule`). No alias — update imports.
  - **`PROFILER_CONTEXT_ADAPTERS` removed** from the public API. It was never consumed by the core; the single supported way to register a context adapter is `ProfilerCoreService.registerContextAdapter(adapter)` from your module's `onModuleInit` (resolve the core with `moduleRef.get(ProfilerCoreService, { strict: false })`). The dead multi-token providers in the GraphQL and RabbitMQ modules are gone.
  - **Named ORM connections supported.** `TypeOrm`/`Mongoose`/`MikroOrm` collector options gain a `connectionName?: string`; the (optionally named) connection is injected by its resolved token, optionally, so a named-only setup no longer crashes at bootstrap and a missing connection warns instead. A `getRequest()` on context adapters lets the interceptor repose the transport request in CLS (fixes GraphQL requests showing as anonymous in the Security panel).
  - **Peer dependencies tightened.** The core peer on every collector is bounded (`>=1.0.0-alpha.7 <2.0.0`) instead of an unbounded `>=`. Optional peers (`axios`, `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq`, `amqplib`, `@nestjs/graphql`, `class-validator`, `class-transformer`) are now declared in `peerDependencies` with ranges (plus `optional: true` in meta). `nest-profiler-http` no longer peer-depends on `@nestjs/axios` (it never imports it — you provide `axiosRef` via `forRootAsync`); `nest-profiler-commander` now declares `nest-commander` as a **required** peer (imported statically) rather than optional. ORM peer ranges widened to cover the installed base: `typeorm ">=0.3.20 <2.0.0"`, `mongoose "^8 || ^9"`. `nest-profiler-mikro-orm` requires Node `>=22.12.0` (stable `require(esm)`).
  - **Misc.** A throwing custom validator extractor can no longer turn a 400 into a 500; the RabbitMQ adapter's options are `@Optional()`; the dead `COMMANDER_COLLECTOR_OPTIONS` token is removed; the RabbitMQ package builds via the shared `repo-build`. `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq` is now a dev dependency.

- 882e5ac: Add `forRootAsync` to every collector whose options are resolved at runtime, so masking, thresholds and capture flags can be driven from `ConfigService` (or any provider) instead of static literals.

  - New `forRootAsync({ imports?, inject?, useFactory })` on `TypeOrmCollectorModule`, `MongooseCollectorModule`, `MikroOrmCollectorModule`, `ConfigCollectorModule`, `AuthCollectorModule`, `RabbitMqCollectorModule` and `ValidatorCollectorModule`, mirroring the existing `HttpCollectorModule.forRootAsync`. Each package also exports a matching `*CollectorModuleAsyncOptions` type.
  - Collectors now share a `ConfigurableModuleBuilder`-based options token and a single `buildCollectorModule` helper (exported from `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`) that centralizes the synchronous `enabled: false` short-circuit — so disabling behaves consistently across every collector.
  - `enabled` stays a synchronous build-time flag (it decides which providers are registered, which an async factory cannot); per-environment gating remains the host's job via `ConditionalModule.registerWhen(...)`. `HttpCollectorModule` is refactored onto the shared builder with no change to its public API (`HTTP_COLLECTOR_OPTIONS`, `HTTP_INSTRUMENTATIONS`, `axios`/`instrumentations` and the `axiosRef` contract are preserved).
  - `cache`, `commander` and `graphql` are intentionally left `forRoot`-only: their sole option is `enabled`, which has nothing to resolve asynchronously.

- a8a149b: Contribute **RabbitMQ** and **Commands** groups to the Routes panel (`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-routes`).

  - `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-rabbitmq`: `RabbitMqRouteSource` scans `@RabbitSubscribe` handlers (via the `RABBIT_HANDLER` metadata) and lists each consumer with its exchange, routing key and handler.
  - `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-commander`: `CommanderRouteSource` scans nest-commander `@Command()` classes and lists each command with its name, declaring class and `--option` flags.

  Both self-register a `ProfilerRouteSource` with the core at bootstrap, so they appear in the panel automatically when the Routes panel package is installed.

- 9b1d8a1: Harden data capture and access control.

  - **Secret redaction everywhere.** A shared redaction utility (`redact`, exported from the core) now masks sensitive object keys (`password`, `token`, `apiKey`, DSN…) and credentials embedded in string values (URL userinfo `user:pass@`, JWTs, `sk-`/`pk-` keys, PEM blocks). It is applied to request headers (`maskHeaders`, default sensitive list — including the raw `cookie` header), config values (DSNs whose key is not itself sensitive, e.g. `DATABASE_URL`), the `@nestjs/config` `_PROCESS_ENV_VALIDATED` firehose is now dropped, SQL parameters (TypeORM/MikroORM), Mongo filters/pipelines, validator rejected values, RabbitMQ payloads, CLI arguments/options, session data, JWT claims and the auth user (now redacted recursively). The redaction sentinel is unified to `[REDACTED]`.
  - **`captureRequestBody` now defaults to `false`** (symmetry with `captureResponseBody`); captured bodies are redacted.
  - **No path traversal / token collisions.** The storage token is always an internal UUID; the client `x-request-id` header is kept only as a display-only `requestId` attribute. The file storage adapter additionally rejects any non-`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` token.
  - **Browser-usable access control.** `ProfilerGuard` now accepts the token via a `?token=` query parameter (not only `Authorization: Bearer`), exempts static assets under `__assets/*`, and compares tokens in constant time. Configuring a token no longer breaks the UI or the injected toolbar.
  - **Security headers** (`Cache-Control: no-store`, strict CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`) on the HTML pages and the JSON export; the `X-Debug-Token` headers can be disabled with `emitDebugHeaders: false`.

## 1.0.0-alpha.7

### Minor Changes

- 157436f: Push list filtering and pagination down to the storage adapter, add server-side pagination and a SQLite backend, and make list filters/sections declarative.

  `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler`:

  - **Server-side pagination**: each list section paginates independently via a `<sectionKey>_page` query param, with a Prev/Next pager. New `listPageSize` option (default `25`).
  - **Storage-level query pushdown**: new structured `ProfilerQuery` / `FilterCriterion` model and optional `query()` / `distinct()` methods on `IProfilerStorageAdapter`. `ProfilerStorageService` exposes `query()` / `distinct()` and, for adapters that don't implement them, falls back to an in-memory implementation over `findAll()` — so a query-capable store (a database, Redis…) can filter, sort, paginate and count natively instead of loading every profile. Exposes `ProfileSummary` / `summarizeProfile`, `applyQueryInMemory`, `selectPage`, `distinctFromSummaries`, `matchesCriterion` and `sectionTypeConstraint` to help build custom adapters.
  - **File storage**: the file adapter now filters/sorts/paginates over an in-memory `ProfileSummary` index persisted in a `_index.meta` sidecar, reading only the current page's `{token}.json` files; it implements the native `query()` / `distinct()` path.
  - **SQLite storage**: a new adapter under the `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler/sqlite` subpath (`better-sqlite3` as an optional peer dependency) stores each profile as an indexed summary row plus the full document and pushes queries down to SQL (`WHERE … ORDER BY … LIMIT/OFFSET` + `COUNT(*)`).
  - `maxProfiles` and `ttl` can now be **disabled** by passing `0` (or a negative value) — no cap / never expire — on every built-in adapter (the `100` / `3600` defaults are unchanged).
  - **BREAKING** — the list-filter and list-section extension API is now declarative so it can be pushed down:
    - `ProfilerListFilter.matches(profile, value)` is replaced by `toCriterion(value): FilterCriterion`; a dynamic `'select'`'s `optionsFor(profiles)` is replaced by `distinctField` (its options come from `storage.distinct()`).
    - `ProfilerListSection.matches(profile)` is removed; a section owns entrypoint `types` (defaulting to its `key`). `bucketProfilesBySection` and `ProfilerListSectionBucket` are removed in favour of `sectionTypeConstraint`.
    - `ProfilerEntrypointType` gains an optional `indexAttributes(profile)` projection so kind-specific facets are indexable and queryable.

  `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-graphql`, `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-rabbitmq`, `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-commander`:

  - Migrate the contributed list filters to the declarative `toCriterion` API and add each entrypoint type's `indexAttributes` projection (GraphQL `operationType`; RabbitMQ `exchange` / `routingKey` / `handler` / `redelivered`; command `success`), so these scoped filters push down to query-capable storage adapters.

## 1.0.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- 8516122: Add Symfony-style "copy" buttons to the profiler UI so captured operations can be replayed in one click.

  - `nest-profiler`: copy the incoming HTTP request as a runnable `curl` command, and copy each SQL query with its bound parameters inlined (supports both `$N` Postgres/TypeORM and `?` MySQL/MikroORM placeholders). Exposes `buildCurlCommand` and `interpolateSql`.
  - `nest-profiler-http`: copy each outgoing HTTP client request as `curl`.
  - `nest-profiler-mongoose`: copy each query as a runnable `mongosh` command; aggregation pipelines are now captured so `aggregate` copies are complete.
  - `nest-profiler-rabbitmq`: copy the message payload and a ready-to-run amqplib `channel.publish(...)` snippet.

## 1.0.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- Version bump only — released in lockstep with `@eleven-labs/nest-profiler` to keep the suite on a single version (Changesets `fixed` group). No functional changes to this package.

## 1.0.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- 13e53f8: New package: capture RabbitMQ messages consumed via `@RabbitSubscribe` (`@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq`).

  `RabbitMqCollectorModule.forRoot()` registers a context adapter for the `rmq` execution context that creates a fresh profile per consumed message with a `rabbitmq` entrypoint (`entrypoint.type = 'rabbitmq'`, the message details — exchange, routing key, handler, redelivered flag, AMQP tags, masked headers and payload — on `entrypoint.data`). The package owns its `RabbitMqInfo` type and `RABBITMQ_ENTRYPOINT_TYPE`, and registers a `rabbitmq` entrypoint type so messages render in their own **RabbitMQ** list table and on a built-in **Message** detail tab (the HTTP request/response tabs are hidden, like CLI commands). The list has its own filter bar — **Delivery** (first delivery / redelivered), **Exchange** and **Handler** (options built from the captured messages) and a free-text **Routing key** — while the HTTP-status filters are hidden, since a message has no HTTP response. Options: `enabled`, `captureHeaders`, `captureBody`, `maskHeaders`.
