Name the Discover contract after **Discover**, and RabbitMQ after **RabbitMQ**.

Two naming inconsistencies had survived the move to per-transport Discover views. The extension point was still called `Route*` while three of its four sources contribute no routes at all — a CLI command, a GraphQL field and a message handler are not routes — and the publish panel was labelled **AMQP** next to a **RabbitMQ** list section, a **RabbitMQ** detail tab and a **RabbitMQ** Discover view, so one broker carried two names.

Discover contract (core, and every source implementing it):

- `ProfilerRouteSource` → `ProfilerDiscoverSource`, `RouteGroup` → `DiscoverGroup`, `RouteEntry` → `DiscoverEntry`, `RouteInputs` / `RouteInputGroup` / `RouteInputItem` → `DiscoverInputs` / `DiscoverInputGroup` / `DiscoverInputItem`, `RouteDtoInfo` / `RouteDtoProperty` → `DiscoverDtoInfo` / `DiscoverDtoProperty`.
- `ProfilerCoreService.registerRouteSource()` → `registerDiscoverSource()`, `getRouteSources()` → `getDiscoverSources()`.
- `DiscoverGroup.routes` → `DiscoverGroup.entries`, and `RoutesCollectorData.routeCount` → `entryCount`.
- The shipped sources follow: `HttpRouteSource` → `HttpDiscoverSource`, `GraphqlRouteSource` → `GraphqlDiscoverSource`, `RabbitMqRouteSource` → `RabbitMqDiscoverSource`, `CommanderRouteSource` → `CommanderDiscoverSource`.

`@eleven-labs/nest-profiler-routes`, `RoutesCollectorModule` and `RoutesCollector` keep their names — the package still ships the built-in HTTP source and owns the panel — as does `RouteCollector`, the core's HTTP route matcher, which is unrelated to Discover.

RabbitMQ naming:

- The publish panel is labelled **RabbitMQ** instead of **AMQP**, and its rule domain is `rabbitmq` instead of `amqp`, so a chatty profile reads `12 rabbitmq calls in one request`. The core's per-domain defaults (`chattyThreshold`, the N+1 subject) move with it.
- `AmqpPublishEntry` → `RabbitMqPublishEntry`. Internals follow suit (`AmqpPublishPatch` → `RabbitMqPublishPatch`, `buildAmqpPublish` → `buildRabbitMqPublish`), and the remaining prose says "RabbitMQ" where it used to say "AMQP", keeping the term only where it names the wire protocol itself.

BREAKING: every renamed symbol above is a published export. No behaviour changes — a consumer importing one updates the import name, and a custom `ProfilerDiscoverSource` renames its `routes` field to `entries`. Nothing in the `?view=` keys, the storage format or the module options changes.
