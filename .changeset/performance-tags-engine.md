Detect performance anti-patterns (N+1, slow, error, chatty, large-payload) across SQL, Mongo and outgoing HTTP with a rule-based tagging engine.

The core now runs a single analysis pass (`analyzeProfile`) once per profile — after every collector, before persistence — that groups entries on a collector-supplied `fingerprint` and applies `PerformanceRule`s, attaching structured `ProfilerTag[]` (`{ id, label, severity, count?, detail? }`) to each entry and aggregating them onto `profile.tags`. Built-in rules: `slow`, `n-plus-one` (the N+1 anti-pattern), `error`, `chatty` and `large-payload` (HTTP). Contribute your own via `ProfilerModule.forRoot({ performance: { rules: [...] } })` or `ProfilerCoreService.registerPerformanceRule()`; the emitted tag ids become filterable.

Tags surface as coloured pills on each query/HTTP row and in the panel headers; the detail page shows a prominent **Performance** banner listing the issues and colour-codes the affected collector's nav tab by severity (the tab badge stays a plain count). On the list page, tags render as pills and a new **Performance tag** filter (Slow / N+1 / Chatty / Large payload, plus any custom id via `registerFilterOption('tag', …)`) plus a separate **With errors** checkbox replace the former **With exceptions** checkbox (errors are failures, not performance issues; the checkbox is broader — it covers failed HTTP/query calls too). The SQLite adapter gains an indexed `tags` column.

**Breaking changes**

- The per-query `isSlow` boolean is removed from `QueryEntry`, `MongooseQueryEntry` and the Mongo entry shape; "slow" is now the `slow` tag, computed centrally by the engine (no longer at capture time). Read it from `entry.tags` (or `profile.tags`).
- Each collector's `slowQueryThreshold` option is renamed to `slowThreshold`, and gains sibling options `nPlusOneThreshold` (default 2) and `chattyThreshold` (default 20; `10` for HTTP). The HTTP collector additionally gains `slowThreshold` (default 300 ms) and `largePayloadThreshold` (default 1 MB).
- The built-in `hasExceptions` list filter is removed in favour of the generic `tag` filter.
